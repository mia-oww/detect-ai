DetectAI - Frontend

This repository contains the front-end web interface for DetectAI â€” a platform designed to detect AI-generated faces using trained neural networks to detect whether an image is a StyleGan fake.

Overview

This frontend is currently a placeholder/base version providing the web interface and user experience design.

It is built to integrate with the backend API (under development) that will serve the AI detection models.

The models are still being trained and refined, so the backend API is not fully operational yet.


Features:

User-friendly UI for image upload and display.

Responsive design adaptable to desktop and mobile.

Future implementations: 

Connecting this frontend to the detection API for real-time AI-generated image classification.

Improve UI/UX based on user feedback.

Implement additional features such as history tracking/cache.
